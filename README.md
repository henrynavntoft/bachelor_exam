If you have problems with PostgreSQL and Prisma, it's probably because you need to deploy or migrate the database. Run these commands inside the Docker container:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# If you need to reset the database (be careful with this in production!)
npx prisma migrate reset
```

Note: Make sure you're inside the Docker container when running these commands. You can access the container using:
```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash
```
